-Included are files that were used in creation of app 

-Assignment 03 generates a random number between 1 - 100 and then the user has to try 
and guess the number.

-JQuery is used to grab the text out the input box and is sanitized to ensure a proper Integer 
is selected by the user.

-The guess is then run through various conditional checks to determine whether it equals the
random number generated
