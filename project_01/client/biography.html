          <li><u><strong>Real Name:</strong></u> &nbsp; Max Eisenhardt</li>
          <li>
            <u><strong>Occupation:</strong></u> &nbsp; 
            Leader & Founder of the Brotherhood of Mutants

            <u><strong>Abilities:</strong></u> &nbsp;

            <u><strong>Backstory:</strong></u> &nbsp; 
            When Magneto (Max) was young, his family was sent to the Holocaust where they all died.
            With the emergence of his powers he was able to survive and have a child after he escaped.  However, after 
            a house fire tragically killed his daughter as a result of a police barricade preventing him from saving her. This enraged him and he lashed out and
            attacked members of the mob before retreating for some time.  These two events shaped Max Eisenhardt to the point where he took an aggressive and lethal stance against humanity..
            After disappearing for awhile he emerged and turned to guerrilla tactics with the goal of mutant supremacy over humans.
          </li>
          <li>
           <u><strong>Tactics:</strong></u> &nbsp;
 			Although his tactics were viewed as unjustified by many humans, Magneto felt the need
 			to protect his kind from more persecution.  
          </li>
          <li>
           <u><strong>Fate:</strong></u> &nbsp;
            Magneto would be acquitted for his previous crimes based on the idea that he had acted as a international entity, much as a nation would have done, and his terrorist acts qualified as acts of war. 
          </li>
    
          <li>
           <u><strong>Public Perception:</strong></u> &nbsp;
           A big debate on whether Magneto is truly a villain due to his actions being the result of acting in self defence
